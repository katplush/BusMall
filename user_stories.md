2) As the developer, I want to create an app that displays proposed products and collects the data from a focus group, to have a clear visual of most popular products.

3) As a focus group participant, I want an easy, uncomplicated application that allows me to select my preferred items, to provide the feedback necessary for me to get paid.

4) As a consumer, I want a catalog that offers a few fun "gotta-have" products that I can review and purchase, to make my long commute more entertaining and allow me an easy convenient way to purchase the birthday gift for so-so I've been putting off.
